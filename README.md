## Merge sort
### Complexity of merge sort
- Time Complexity: O(N log(N))
- Space Complexity: O(N)
### Advantages of Merge Sort:
- Stability: Merge sort is a stable sorting algorithm, which means it maintains the relative order of equal elements in the input array.
- Guaranteed worst-case performance: Merge sort has a worst-case time complexity of O(N logN), which means it performs well even on large datasets.
- Parallelizable: Merge sort is a naturally parallelizable algorithm, which means it can be easily parallelized to take advantage of multiple processors or threads.
